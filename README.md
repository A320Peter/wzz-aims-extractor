# WiZZ-AIMS-eXtractor
This utility is for downloading and converting your logbook data from WiZZ Air AIMS to a CSV file that can be imported to electronic logbooks (eg. mccPILOTLOG). 

I wrote this tool as an experiment for my own interest. I share the code as I have received a lots of request. By downloading the script you fully agree with the Acceptable Usage Policy and Security Overview.

If you are not a Wizz Air pilot you should stop now. This script is useless for you.

This script was written in Python 3.7 and free to use.

# Acceptable Usage Policy

The use of the script downloaded on this site is done at your own discretion and risk and with agreement that you will be solely responsible for consequences resulted from the usage of the tool.

I make no warranty that

- the script will meet your requirements
- the script will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free
- the results that may be obtained from the use of the script will be effective, accurate or reliable
- the quality of the script will meet your expectations
- any errors in the script obtained from me will be corrected. 

# Security Overview
Authentication and data fetching is fully compliant with security policy. No login name or password stored at anywhere. Password is encrypted before posting request. No influence on any AIMS settings. The script only fetches your roster and logbook data. The application will terminate in case of active changes in your roster preventing accidentally accepting any notifications. This tool uses the same URL request method like any other AIMS fetching tool in Google Play Store or App Store. If you have any concern or dubt, feel free to inspect the source code.
