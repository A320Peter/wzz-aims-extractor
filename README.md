# WiZZ-AIMS-eXtractor
This utility is for downloading and converting your logbook data from WiZZ Air AIMS to a CSV file that can be imported to electronic logbooks (eg. mccPILOTLOG). 

I wrote this tool as an experiment for my own interest. I share the code as I have received a lots of request. By downloading the script you fully agree with the Acceptable Usage Policy and Security Overview.

If you are not a Wizz Air pilot you should stop now. This script is useless for you.
